    "reasoning": "While the solution starts with good practices including proper documentation, type checking, and the right parsing approach, it's fundamentally incomplete. The code cuts off after splitting the ARN and doesn't implement the core logic to extract and return the bucket name (which should be `arn_parts[5]` after validation). A complete solution would need to validate the ARN has 6 parts, verify it's a proper S3 ARN format, and return the final component.",
